WR Mack Hollins and OLB Harold Landry III are big losses if they can't get right, but this Patriots team has a talented, well-coached roster with nothing to lose and everything to gain.

But there is one area they absolutely can improve in prior to the postseason: the red zone. Their 60% TD rate down there ranks them in the upper half of the league, and their 39 TDs are impressive, but Sunday brought two more RZ turnovers, raising their season total to six.

If Denver can run the ball and control the clock like it did in Kansas City, things should be OK.

The 49ers really need to be this efficient offensively to run through a stout NFC field in the postseason, but it feels more possible now than it has all season.

Two touchdowns in the final two possessions made a comeback win possible, but a blocked extra point and a failed two-point conversion did Buffalo in. Was it a crushing loss? No, but it did cede the AFC East to the Patriots -- a development that was seemingly unthinkable in August -- and will force the Bills to take a longer road through the playoffs.

But just like the trip to Green Bay in early December, it wasn't meant to be.

I didn't walk away from Sunday night's game discouraged about the Bears, but I suspect Chicago’s lack of athleticism on the defensive front will be its eventual undoing, with some high-powered attacks dotting the NFC playoff field.

The Power Rankings reflect both a team's inner strength and, especially at this time of year, the path it must take to reach the Super Bowl. Some of that lost value might have been baked in prior to the loss at Atlanta, so I didn't murder the Rams a second time in this pecking order, but don't think I wasn't disappointed and surprised. It now appears they could be the No. 6 seed, potentially facing a road trip to either Chicago or Philadelphia. Los Angeles also has a problem at left tackle if Alaric Jackson (knee) can't return to health, as D.J. Humphries struggled mightily on Monday.

But the seventh-round rookie has made Mike McDaniel look smarter for giving him a shot after a very respectable effort against the Buccaneers. Facing a team that was desperate to win a game, Ewers registered a terrific first half and played turnover-free ball in the upset victory. He also had help from some other unheralded Dolphins rookies (Theo Wease Jr., Zeek Biggers and Jason Marshall Jr.) who played well and similarly helped their 2026 causes. Too little, too late, but Miami has looked pretty solid in the second half of the season."

It wasn't the Super Bowl send-off the Chiefs had hoped for, but it will have to do if he is indeed done after this season. Kansas City would face identity questions this offseason without him -- and with Patrick Mahomes rehabbing a major knee injury -- but it could be good for this franchise to build its infrastructure a bit more and learn how to win in new ways. Andy Reid says he'll be back in 2026, and Mahomes eventually will be, too, but it's no certainty that the Chiefs will have anything close to the same firepower they once did."

I don't think Dan Quinn should be feeling the heat about his job, but it certainly changes the perspective for 2026. Can Washington afford another poor season? I was happy to see Jer'Zhan Newton's breakout game in the loss to Dallas, but Washington's defense needs an extreme makeover this coming offseason, which begs the question of why more wasn't done to help that unit this past offseason. There are still encouraging elements regarding the health of the organization, but the draft till has been drained via trades with a win-now mentality. It backfired, but now the Commanders must find reasonable approaches to being competitive next season."

It was another sub-17-point performance on offense, but the defense rose to the challenge and stunted the Steelers -- though ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Myles Garrett﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ was unable to break the sack record, seemingly facing a crowd of blockers on most pass plays. The loss hurt the Browns' draft outlook and could keep them out of range for a quarterback, although they have the picks to move up if they so desire. Where Cleveland goes at that position in the offseason will be fascinating, especially with ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Shedeur Sanders﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ doing enough good things to suggest he could be part of the solution. Then again, when it comes to the Browns, it's anyone's guess as to how it'll all unfold."

He threw some big-time passes in the loss to the Saints, and there has been a tangible uptick in his play recently -- that's four straight games with two TD passes. Even still, Tennessee's next head coach will have to sell himself on making Ward a more consistent player in Year 2, assuming the Titans can provide him with more help on both sides of the ball. Some of the weapons appear to be in place, but they'll need better blocking and a more efficient offensive system to coax greatness out of Ward."

It's not often you see a 2-0 start to the season so thoroughly flushed away, but here we are. What it means for Jonathan Gannon is yet to be determined, but two things are certain: This was Arizona's fifth double-digit blowout since the Week 8 bye and yet another game where the defense was taken to the woodshed. Defense is Gannon's supposed calling card, and yet that unit -- in spite of many big additions in the past few seasons -- has been a major disappointment, especially down the stretch. Even accounting for the impact of injuries, it seems clear something must change drastically on that side of the ball. There's also the looming ﻿﻿﻿Kyler Murray﻿﻿﻿ situation, setting up a pretty significant offseason in Glendale."

Sure, it would have been nice to get the top pick and sell it to a team such as the Raiders or Jets for QB ransom, but the Giants will end up with one of the best non-quarterbacks, and they can probably go into the spring feeling good that Jaxson Dart might have been QB1 had he been in this coming draft class. We first need to see who stays and who goes, but there's at least a foundation in place -- if you believe Dart is The Guy -- for a new coach to be competitive next season. Can Dart stay healthy and get better? Those are legit questions."

They were absolutely undressed defensively (and yes, the INT-less streak remains!) and not functional offensively while the Patriots were building a massive first-half lead. Worse yet, they were pretty lifeless to start the game. The one standout, of course, was Breece Hall, who ripped off a 59-yard touchdown and averaged almost 8 yards per carry. In doing so, he surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing mark, becoming the first Jets player to do so in a decade -- one of the few highlights of another poor season. After not dealing Hall in an active trade deadline for the franchise, the Jets are almost forced to meet the running back's contract demands this spring. They'll have a laundry list of needs beyond that, too."

The Geno experiment just hasn't worked out as hoped, with the 34-10 loss to the Giants raising his INT total to a league-worst 17 and moving the Raiders into the driver's seat for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Whether that pick lands Vegas the passer of the future or not remains to be seen, but it's clear that could be one of several major changes to occur. We need to see what Pete Carroll's future is, and then there's the whole Maxx Crosby situation. Once again, the Raiders are a near-teardown, and it's no guarantee they'll do enough in the offseason to be competitive."
