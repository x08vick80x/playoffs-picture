  "10-3",
  "A week after their first loss since early October, the Rams racked up season highs in points (45) and yards from scrimmage (530) in a road beatdown of the Cardinals. Arizona played tough early but collapsed under the onslaught of Los Angeles' persistent and balanced attack. Right now, the Kyren Williams-Blake Corum backfield combo looks like a real winner. The Rams nearly ran for as many yards (249) as they threw for (281) on Sunday, and their only negative plays on offense came on a few annoying penalties. Other than that, they were dominant, rewarding my faith in them -- keeping them in the No. 1 spot -- after the Week 13 defeat at Carolina. Tough games lie ahead against the Lions and Seahawks, the latter of which likely will decide the NFC West and could seal the top seed for the Rams."
